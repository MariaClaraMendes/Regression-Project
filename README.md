# Regression Project

In this case is possible to work through a study regression predictive modeling problem in Python including each step of the applied machine learning process. Some steps of the process:

- [x] How to use data transforms to improve model performance.
- [x] How to use algorithm tunning to improve model performance.
- [x] How to use ensemble methods and tunning of ensemble methods to improve model performance. 

## Problem Definition

For this project the Boston House Price dataset was investigated. Each record in the dataset describes a Boston suburb or town. The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Area (SMSA) in 1970. 

The attributes are defined as follows (taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston):

1. CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
2. ZN: proportion of residencial land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
3. INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
4. CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
5. NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
6. RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
7. AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
8. DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
9. RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
10. TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
11. PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
12. B: 1000(Bk âˆ’ 0:63)2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population
14. MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

## Summary of the Jupyter Notebook

- [x] Problem Definition (Boston house price data).
- [x] Loading the Dataset.
- [x] Analyze Data (some skewed distributions and correlated attributes).
- [x] Evaluate Algorithms (Linear Regression looked good).
- [x] Evaluate Algorithms with Standardization (KNN looked good).
- [x] Algorithm Tuning (K=3 for KNN was best).
- [x] Ensemble Methods (Bagging and Boosting, Gradient Boosting looked good).
- [x] Tuning Ensemble Methods (getting the most from Gradient Boosting).
- [x] Finalize Model (use all training data and confirm using validation dataset)
